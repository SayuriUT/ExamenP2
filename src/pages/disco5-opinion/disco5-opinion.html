              There are many personal reasons for my fascination with this album ((Travelling to Sweden whilst first listening to this on the fucking 8 hour United Airlines flight to Arlanda//My association with this album and the carefree sexiness of the Russian cartoon Nu Pogodi))). Organized and comprehensively layed out in the manner similar to the following "Visitors (1981)", but carrying through, albeit much more convincingly, the pop sensiblitiy of The VISITORS, The ALBUM, and so on. Me And I remains a classic reminder of interior drama, despite its upbeat stylistics. A hat off to ABBA for this.          </ion-card-content>

              Being Swedish I'm kind of bound to like ABBA. Maybe I don't care for all the music on this record or as ABBA as a band, but even if ABBA isn't the most amazing band in the world, Super Trouper is an amazing piece of work.          </ion-card-content>

              Seriously, I rarely have heard Abba made a bad song. Even the non hits, all the album tracks are perfectly composed and constructed. Even the Beatles had a couple bad songs on some of their albums. Not Abba in my opinion. All their albums are as good. Get all their complete discography and ask yourself why they always been more underrated then the Beatles. Unpretentious pop music at it's best.          </ion-card-content>
