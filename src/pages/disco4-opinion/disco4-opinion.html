              This is a really underrated album. Nancy Mulligan, How do you Feel and Hearts don't break Around Here can all be considered folk-pop songs but for the most part, Ed Sheeran transitions from making folk-pop to pop with influences of folk. I think that he pulls off this transition really well. It's not a perfect album though. The really catchy melody in the instrumentation that plays during the hook of Galway Girl is a sample, Shape of You is a pretty bad song and there's really no need for Perfect to exist since Dive is also on the album which is basically a higher quality version of Perfect. The instrumentation of this album has enough variety to be interesting with the Irish Influences of Nancy Mulligan, and the alternitave hip hop sounds of Eraser and New Man. There are also some pop ballads and piano ballads. The instrumentals of Perfect and Shape of You are pretty bad and some of the guitar playing could have sounded better but most of the instrumentation on this album ends up being enjoyable especially on tracks like Bibia Be Ye Ye and Nancy Mulligan. The melodies of these songs are mostly good especially the melodies of Bibia Be Ye Ye, Nancy Mulligan, Supermarket Flowers and What do I know. It's a solid album overall.          </ion-card-content>

              This is honestly way worse than I thought.  Rappin' Ed is not a great look, especially with the awful instrumentation that is often beneath it.  Like the first place my mind went was the Barenaked Ladies.  But like a half-rate Barenaked Ladies, because comparing this to the Barenaked Ladies is an insult to Barenaked Ladies.  Rappin' Ed is really bad.

              'Shape of You' is honestly a really good cut.  The melodies and rhythms of the vocal line flow really well in the way that good pop vocals do, and the instrumentation is spare but cool.
              
              Most all of the acoustic singer/songwriter stuff is really bleh bland.          </ion-card-content>

              One of my favorite modern pop acts, Sheeran continues his domination of poppy guitar tracks that have cross-genre appeal. While his songwriting is still pretty bubblegum, the man can write some of the best hooks in the industry. At 16 songs and almost exactly an hour long, there's a lot of material to choose from. The teenie-boppers may continue to swoon at the pop idol, but consider me a fan.          </ion-card-content>
