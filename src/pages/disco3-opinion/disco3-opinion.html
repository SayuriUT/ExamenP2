              Queen's key album. It's everything they are in one package - ludicrously pompous, bizarrely experimental, inexplicably heavy and eclectic as all shit. It's such a pleasant thing to sit in. The familiar, the beautiful, the surprising. Stabbing at it in 2018 I was taken aback by the swollen majesty of the Prophet's Song which is such a song                </ion-card-content>

              So much Queen goodness here, the first side is all incredible, especially "Death on Two Legs", "I'm in Love With My Car", "You're My Best Friend" and "'39".  Usually that's enough great songs for one whole album, but that is the first side, and there is plenty more to blush about on the second side.  Starting with the incredible epic "The Prophet's Song", which actually segues perfectly into the beautiful "Love of My Life".  The apex of this entire album to many is the operatic epic "Bohemian Rhapsody", always talked about as being one of the greatest songs ever recorded, and for good reason.  Aided by Mercury's incredible vocals (don't think I need to mention he's awesome throughout the album) and May's excellent guitar work in the heavier sections, it certainly qualifies as one of those all time great epics.  So, A Night at the Opera, good or not?            </ion-card-content>

                      Without a doubt, the best Queen's album ever, their very masterpiece. For whatever reason, Queen's career has always been a sort of up and down, great LPs followed by ugly and unpredictable works. Well, this is defenetly the biggest UP! Only the mere presence of songs like "Love of my life" and "Bohemian Rhapsody" (imho, one of the best songs ever written in rock history) is a reason good enough to purchase this album. But there are also other tracks that deserve attention, and that make A night at the Opera an all times classic. Nevertheless, a few poor songs appear, which is the reason why I don't rate it a full 5 stars. Still, a must have from Queen's discography.                    </ion-card-content>
